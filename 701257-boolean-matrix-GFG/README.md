# [Boolean Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/boolean-matrix-problem-1587115620/1)
## Medium
Given a boolean matrix mat[], where each cell contains either 0 or 1, modify it such that if a matrix cell matrix[i][j] is 1 then all the cells in its ith&nbsp;row and jth&nbsp;column will become 1.
Examples:
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
Output: [[1, 1], [1, 0]] 
Explanation: Only cell that has 1 is at (0,0) so all cells in row 0 are modified to 1 and all cells in column 0 are modified to 1.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
Output: [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0]]
Explanation: The position of cells that have 1 in the original matrix are (0, 0), (1, 0) and (2, 0). Therefore, all cells in row 0, 1, 2 are and column 0 are modified to 1. 
Input: mat[][] = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]
Output: [[0, 0], [0, 0]] 
Explanation: There is no cell that contains 1, so mat[] will remain the same.
Constraints:1 ≤ mat.size(), mat[0].size() ≤ 1030 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1
